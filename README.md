[PLACE HOLDER] is a reproduction of DeepSeek R1 Zero in vision centric tasks. We built upon Open-R1-Multimodal and R1-V.

Through applying GRPO on the 2B base LM develops self-verification autonomously and exhibits an emergent ability to "take another look" at the image and correct its mistakes.

1. We are the **first to replicate a key characteristic** of R1 success (**‚Äùaha moment‚Äù** and **increasing reasoning length**) on **multimodal** reasoning tasks.

2. We showed that **vision-centric** tasks could also benefit from improved reasoning capabilities.

> Training dynamics of our [Place Holder] training starting from the Qwen-VL-2B, without SFT or reward models. An aha moment and increasing response length is ever observed at a multimodal model.

Similar to DeepSeek R1, self reflection behavior is also observed during our RL training on vision-centric reasoning tasks: the model exhibits an emergent ability to rethink and correct its mistakes.:

Therefore, dark brown wooden bed with white blanket is not above the doorway.
But wait! I can think of something else.
Maybe it's just higher than above the doorway, but slightly lower than above the doorway.

### Updates:
- 2025-02-24: We release the [PLACE HOLDER] repo.


## Setup

```bash
bash setup.sh
```
## Prepare Dataset

```bash
cd src/data/SAT
bash prepare_dataset.sh
```

## Training

### GRPO Training
To reproduce the multimodal aha moment, run the following code:
```bash
cd src/open-r1-multimodal
sh run_grpo_SAT.sh # Adjust open-r1-multimodal/configs/zero3.yaml or zero2.yaml accordingly
```

### SFT Training

```bash
cd src/open-r1-multimodal
sh run_sft.sh # Adjust open-r1-multimodal/configs/zero3.yaml or zero2.yaml accordingly
```

## Evaluation

### CVBench Evaluation
```bash
cd src/eval
python test_qwen2vl_CVBench.py 
```
